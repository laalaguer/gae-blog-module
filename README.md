## gae-blog-module
Blog related module on GAE (google app engine), including picture upload, client side javascript, server side, html editor, roles of visitor, admin, tag system, etc.

## modules and design principles

1. Seperation principle: every module shall function and have least relationship with other modules as possible.

2. I want some functionalities out of GAE so I can copy-paste these libraries and use it directly in different projects.

3. These functionalities are supposed to be related to 'blogs' and 'personal website' and 'shops', so I will gradually feed into this collection some functionalities.

These are the building stonese of your greate mansion. Be alert when I add new into them.
